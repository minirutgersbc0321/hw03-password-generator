PASSWORD GENERATOR

Description: A password is randomly generated based on the criteria that the user provides when prompted.

When the user clicks the button "Generate Password", they are first alerted with the minimum characters requirement. Then promoted for password length. If the lenth is outside the range of 8-20, the user is prompted once again to enter a password length within the range. The prompt will loop until the user enters a valid number.

The program then prompts the user to define if they would like to include numbers,special characters, uppercase and/or lowercase letters. If the user selects none to all criteria, the program will ask it to select at least each one and will loop back through the prompts.

When all parameters have been defined, the password will appear within the password box.

Technologies Used: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
